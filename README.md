Tally Android App - "Insert catching Slogan Here"

Tally is a natively Android app that allows users to follow not just any politician, but the politicians that directly affect THEIR county,
prescinct, state, ect. automatically. It contains a list of these politicians, the upcoming political events that are happening in their 
county, a feed of the news their reps are creating + the recent bills they've passed, and even an explore button to see what other 
politicians in other areas of the state are up to. We love the news at Tally, and want to use the news to help rebuild our divided nation. 

Thanks for checking us out!
